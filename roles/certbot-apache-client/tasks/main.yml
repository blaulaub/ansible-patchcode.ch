# note: managing certificates is a manual process, ansible will only be used to
# provide the bare necessities. In particular, extending the list of subdomains
# is not automated. The list of requested subdomain certificates can be
# expanded by:
#   certbot --expand -d patchcode.ch,smtp.patchcode.ch,www.patchcode.ch,<etc>
#
# This generally requires forwarding of port 80 and 443 to the certbot client
# machine (see "roles/nat-router" and "group_vars/all/network_routes.yml").
#
# For new subdomains this requires changing the DNS zone records, to avoid
# NXDOMAIN during certbot's ACME verification.
#
# You can check existing certificates on the client by calling something like
# "openssl x509 -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/patchcode.ch/cert.pem -text"
# or even simpler "certbot certificates".
